[](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyrhttps://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/tree/main/boards/arm/rddrone\_fmuk66)We will work to add examples of how to use it here in the near future.\
Meanwhile there are examples os using PWM and other interfaces which can be found in the&#x20;

### Local Zephyr Repo

It is possible in the future that some development has taken place that is not yet pushed to Zephyr/ Main. Below is our local working repo where we may be working on updates.\


{% hint style="info" %}
Note there are many branches in this local repo.&#x20;

You can use pr-multi-socketcan for using multiple socketcan interfaces in parallel.

For any other development checkout pr-fmuk66-board\
