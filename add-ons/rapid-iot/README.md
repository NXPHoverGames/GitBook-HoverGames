# Rapid IoT Prototyping Kit

## About the Rapid IoT Prototyping Kit

> NXP’s Rapid IoT Prototyping Kit is a comprehensive, secure and power-optimized solution designed to accelerate prototype and development of an IoT end node.
>
> Rapid IoT integrates 11 NXP devices \(microcontroller, low-power connectivity, sensors, NFC, secure element, power management, interface\) in a small form-factor hardware design, and combines it with proven software enablement \(drivers, RTOS, middleware, cloud connect\) and a web IDE with GUI based programming.
>
> Rapid IoT provides the easiest and fastest path for anyone to take their connected thing idea to a proof-of-concept. -- [**NXP.com**](https://www.nxp.com/design/development-boards/rapid-prototyping/nxp-rapid-iot-prototyping-kit:IOT-PROTOTYPING)\*\*\*\*

## Connecting the Rapid IoT to the FMUK66

An adapter board will be available that allows you to easily connect the Rapid IoT to the FMUK66. This RDDRONE-IOT  or "HDIB board" \(**H**overGames **D**rone **I**oT Adapter **B**oard\) has JST-GH connectors for UART, CAN and debugging. It also has two [mikroBUS](https://www.mikroe.com/mikrobus) sockets for connecting all kinds of [Click Boards](https://www.mikroe.com/click). More information is available on its own page:
