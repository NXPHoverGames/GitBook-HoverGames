#### July 14, 2020

* The [development tools](developerguide/tools/) section in the developer guide has been updated. Because of changes in the [PX4 toolchain](developerguide/tools/toolchain-installation.md) and [MCUXpresso](developerguide/tools/mcuxpresso.md) some information and screenshots were outdated.&#x20;
* Note that the preconfigured [virtual machine image](downloads.md#preconfigured-virtual-machine-image-with-development-tools) has _not yet_ been updated, but it can still be used without any issue in its current state. However, it should now also be a little bit more straightforward to install your own VM from scratch!

#### July 6, 2020

* We added [a video about programming FMUK66 for first use](userguide/programming.md#video-tutorial). It shows you step-by-step how to flash the bootloader and PX4 firmware binary on the FMUK66 when you take it out of the box for the first time. Keep in mind that you can also [upgrade the PX4 firmware with QGroundControl](userguide/qgroundcontrol/firmware.md) after the bootloader has been programmed!
