## Recent updates

May 2025

* The update MR-HGK-RT is available , but the docs here still need updating with new images and some details.&#x20;
* Please note the following:
  * Need to update docs to show the new MR-VMU-RT1176 flight controller, however the  connections / names of where wires and peripherals should connect are the same
  * The updated kit uses larger "pancake style" motors.
  * The Pancake style motor ONLY have nuts threaded clockwise. This is OK. Just be certain to tighen well.
  * There is an "octopus wire harness" that is used instead of the power distribution board.  The Board may still included, but not used. The board also may not have any connectors on it- but again it is unused.
  * There are extra short M3 screws to hold on the motors that SHOULD be in the soft shell case with the propellers and other accessories. The ones packaged with the motors themselves are a bit too long.\


### Archived updates

#### July 16, 2020

* A page about [Git source code management](developerguide/git.md) has been added.

  * [HG-PX4 Example Lab 1: uORB Subscribe](developerguide/px4-tutorial-example-code/hg-px4-example-lab-1.md)
  * [HG-PX4 Example Lab 2: uORB Publish](developerguide/px4-tutorial-example-code/hg-px4-example-lab-2.md)

  * [HG-PX4 Example Lab 4: Running Code](developerguide/px4-tutorial-example-code/hg-px4-example-lab-4.md)
  * [HG-PX4 Example Lab 5: Build your own PX4 app](developerguide/px4-tutorial-example-code/hg-px4-example-lab-5.md)

#### July 14, 2020

* The [development tools](developerguide/tools/) section in the developer guide has been updated. Because of changes in the [PX4 toolchain](developerguide/tools/toolchain-installation.md) and [MCUXpresso](developerguide/tools/mcuxpresso.md) some information and screenshots were outdated.&#x20;
* Note that the preconfigured [virtual machine image](downloads.md#preconfigured-virtual-machine-image-with-development-tools) has _not yet_ been updated, but it can still be used without any issue in its current state. However, it should now also be a little bit more straightforward to install your own VM from scratch!

#### July 6, 2020

* We added [a video about programming FMUK66 for first use](userguide/programming.md#video-tutorial). It shows you step-by-step how to flash the bootloader and PX4 firmware binary on the FMUK66 when you take it out of the box for the first time. Keep in mind that you can also [upgrade the PX4 firmware with QGroundControl](userguide/qgroundcontrol/firmware.md) after the bootloader has been programmed!
